Git is a version control system (VCS) that lets developers keep track of changes to a code project over time. It allows developers to create "commits" of changes to the code, and then "revert" to previous versions if needed. It also lets developers "branch" the code, which allows them to work on different versions of the project at the same time. This makes it easy for developers to work together on the same code project, and also makes it easy to fix mistakes or roll back changes. In addition, Git makes it easy to "merge" different versions of the codeÂ together
