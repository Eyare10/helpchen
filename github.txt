GitHub is a website and service that allows developers to store, share, and collaborate on code projects. Developers can create their own "repositories" (or "repos" for short) on GitHub, which are basically just folders that contain the code for a project. The code in a repo can be edited and updated over time, and developers can "fork" a repo to create their own version of it. Repos on GitHub can be made public or private, and they can be accessed and used by other developers. This makes GitHub a great tool for collaboration and sharing codeÂ projects.
